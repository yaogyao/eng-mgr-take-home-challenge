0, checkout the repo, "cd" to the repo directory

1, build and test
mvn clean package

check to make sure all tests passed

2, build docker image
docker build -t demo .

"demo" is the image tag used in the docker-compose.yml

3, bring up the app via docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d

make sure to clean up any previous setup by "docker compose down"

4, run http requests against http://localhost:3000/, following the README.MD

Note:
if you want to run and test the app in IDE (e.g. intellj idea), you will need to comment out (disable) the
service.app section, or change the port in application.properties to differentiate the port 3000 used by
the docker-compose.yml
